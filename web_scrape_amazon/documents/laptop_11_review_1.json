    "text": "So 1st of all I got this laptop in 41000 during Amazon Great Indian festival.Now about the laptop.I got this laptop delivered in 9 days which can be considered a ling period but fine by me.The outer box was damaged but inside it was all perfect, so no problem with that.I Don't think this will be a decision maker and please don't make it oneLooks amd design are the best , literally it looks cool and 14 inches make it most beautiful.ok, now , before buying the laptop I saw many critics of display, but tbh yeah the display is not that \"oled or wuxga quality but as a student I have no problem,like it is pretty normal screen very normal,so if you have very high quality display needs then don't buy this but if you are student or evrn a working professional like me, so yeah the critics were somewhat right but its ok to be honest, it will do the job.Now battery, now this one is tough to answer, I saw one comment which said 1 hr battery life, ohk yes the battery life is low, but not 1 hr, here is what I have found after using for 10 days:2 hr battery: intense gaming (played honkai rail star, rocket league, genshin impact, can play valorant too)3.5-4.5 hrs: Net surfing and video streaming5hr-6 hr : pdf and book reading (which I as a student use it most for)See it is a H grade processor,but it is okay guys, chill, it has fast charing too, but I don't use it, cuz yeah \"dell\" in its laptop says the battery health gets depleted,so it must be true for lenovo too.Processor: It is i5 12th gen BUT a H GRADE , SO IT HAS GAMING CAPABILITY,I played games, it does the work but don't think you will give you performance like dedicated gpu) bit it is faster than 13th gen U processor (you can see the scores online), but yeah the battery life is low due to this only. So yeah again normal-normal.Hardware is top notch, the keyboard quality is good.So all in all it is very good laptop, it will get all your normal needs done, go for it ,you will get it in 45k in sale.
