    "text": "I read a lot of reviews about this laptop, so I was aware that it would be slow and that there would be a heating problem, which is understandable given its low price. You can't expect it to perform like a laptop that costs 50,000 INR. I did face issues: it is slow, it heats up a little on the left side of the keyboard, the battery backup is not good, and there is problem while watching videos. I bought it because I wanted to use it for browsing and occasionally using MS Office.After 12 days of usage, I received an update, and when I tried to install it, the laptop wouldn't turn on. I'm lucky that this happened before the expiration of the replacement period.I would suggest everyone to buy branded laptops, even if they don\u2019t have Windows 11 or powerful processors and RAM. For 12 days, it worked fine, though it wasn\u2019t on par with an i5 or better processors. If I compare it with my 9 years old I5 5th generation laptop then more or less both are same.Apart from the product another worst thing is the delivery which takes 1 week. Don't be under the assumption that we get Amazon's product before expected date.I faced the same issue even after getting replacement. This is totally a useless product. If you can use it without updating you can take a risk of buying. Read more",
