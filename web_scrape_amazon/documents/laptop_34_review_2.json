Charging Issue and Screen Flickering in New Laptop \u2013 Needs Immediate AttentionReviewI recently purchased this laptop, and unfortunately, I'm facing an issue with the charging. Whenever I plug it in to charge, the screen starts blinking intermittently, and for a few seconds, it even goes completely black. This happens every time I plug it in, regardless of whether it's on battery or plugged into the charger.I have attached a video to showcase the problem for a clearer understanding. Despite the laptop being brand new, this issue seems to persist. I\u2019ve tried reconnecting the charger, performing a power reset, and checking for any loose connections, but the problem still exists.Pros- The laptop is fast and smooth when it's working fine.- The design and build quality are great.**Cons**:- Screen flickering and blackouts during charging.- Battery charging seems inconsistent at times.I hope the manufacturer can look into this issue and provide a solution, as this is a significant concern with a new device.Bettery problem drain.Don not by on this website Read more",
