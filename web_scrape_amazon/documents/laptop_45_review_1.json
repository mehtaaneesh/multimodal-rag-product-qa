    "text": "I am writing this review after using this beauty for around 15 days and I must say it's a beast in all categories be it CPU, GPU, SSD, RAM and the most powerful is the battery life, I mean I have used almost all gaming brand laptops Asus, Acer, MSI but none of them could manage to give me a battery backup of 3+ hrs. But this beast is giving me around 7+ hrs of backup on normal usage of downloading, surfing and streaming. Till date I haven't seen any heating issues with the laptop.You might get distracted due to some negative comments of this laptop but trust me you would not regret a bit after buying this laptop.FPS in games-Indiana Jones- 85-90 FPS in ultra settingsValorant - 230 FPS in ultraRest all will update after playing some new games.
