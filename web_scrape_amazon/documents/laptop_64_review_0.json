    "text": "Unusable, pathetic, don't waste your money on this or other Jio products.Basic user interface such as double-clicking an icon to open the folder or app does not work properly -- when double-clicked, the icon simply disappears! Plus, you have to use an external keyboard and mouse, because if you use the in-built mouse and keyboard, the cursor jumps all over the place so much that you cannot even type in one sentence properly without the cursor jumping off to other places!Basic apps such as text editor, Word-equivalent, etc do not work properly. If you create a document in Office TextMaker which is pre-installed, and then save the doc, later TextMaker does not open that doc, it complains that the file format it saved the doc in is not supported! And, if you open a doc or docx file, modify it and then try to save it, instead of simply saving the file in the same format it asks you to select a format from a dozen options! Atrocious.Google Meet does not work properly. Many Android apps are not available or supported on this JioBook.This device tries to be both Android and a Linux laptop, ends up being neither. If you get fed up with its atrocious interface, there is no way to dual-install Linux or get basic Linux facilities such as a command terminal.The battery died in less than a year -- fortunately it was in the warranty period.Finally, email to their advertised customer care address bounces back! This company has abandoned this product and its users, and after doing that it does not even provide a way for users to skip their JioOS and install Linux, after JioOS is such a disaster. Never trust any hardware product from this company or their customer support! Read more",
